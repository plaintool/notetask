# Notetask

Notetask, a free and open-source cross-platform task manager for Windows and Linux. The core idea of Notetask is simple: it stores tasks and notes in plain text files where each line represents a separate task or note. Users can also choose to save their files in an encrypted format for personal information, while all data remains local to their device.

Thanks to its flexible interface customization, users can choose which elements and fields to display, allowing Notetask to function not only as a task manager but also as a notes organizer or a secure personal data storage. Interface settings are saved individually for each file, so every document can have its own preferred layout and visible fields.

Notetask provides a customizable interface and offers a range of features to manage tasks effectively, including automatic numbering, grouping, archiving, duration tracking, task highlighting, merging and indenting tasks, as well as copy/paste in Markdown format.

## Features:
- **Numbering** — Tasks are numbered automatically based on their order of appearance in the file
- **Move tasks** — single or multiple, within or between groups; task priority is set simply by its position in the list
- **Archive tasks** — cross out archived items, which can be hidden or shown as needed
- **Grouping** — each group on its own page, with full group management
- **Track duration** — per-task (on/off) and **total duration** for all or selected tasks
- **Track amount** — per-task quantities or prices and **total amount** for all or selected tasks
- **Merge tasks** — combine multiple tasks into one
- **Split tasks** — split a single task into multiple tasks based on the selected column; each line break in the column becomes a new task, while all other columns are copied to each new task
- **Indent tasks** — create subtasks and task hierarchies
- **Highlight** — automatic background highlighting of overdue tasks, text highlighting of archived but incomplete tasks and blue text for tasks with a future due date
- **Copy tasks** — copy selected tasks or fields in Markdown format
- **Paste tasks** — insert individual fields or entire tasks from clipboard
- **Encrypt files** — password-based encryption and decryption of task files for secure storage and sharing

- **Status bar summary** — shows totals of dates and amounts separately for **completed** and **incomplete** tasks
